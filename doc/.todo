Features:

    ☐ Task Monitor React App

        ✔ Initial base implementation @done(23-02-26 21:30)
        ☐ The `all` tab needs to be paged or loaded as user scrolls
        ✔ Task last ran stats @done(23-02-26 21:47)
        ✔ Fix - Runtimes displaying 00:00:00:000 still @done(23-03-05 09:37)
        ☐ Save state / re-order after `pinned` on or off
        ☐ Reveal task file in file explorer and/or taskexplorer tree from  monitor
            Use 'eye' icon button, maybe next to pin icon button
            Implement `reveal api` on trees
        ☐ Filter by task type for tabs
            Just `all` tab,  or for all displayed tabs?  Use task type icons.
            Either a new tabstrip, or if possible a flyout menu, upper right menu button inline w/ top tabstrip
            Or possible to include menu in vs code embedded little context menu in uper right corder of editor?
        ✔ Fix - Timer resetting to 0:00 when task finishes @done(23-03-05 09:37)

        ✔ Apply limits for unlicensed mode?  Or full-featured? @done(23-07-20 03:08)
        ☐ Graph usage over time

            seperate semi-clear buttons too for rntimes,  runcounts, etc
        ☐ Always display vertical scrollbar
            so page doesnt jump when switching tabs if 1 pghas and 1 pg doesn't
